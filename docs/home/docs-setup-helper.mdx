## Local Setup

### Install npm

``` sh
curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.39.3/install.sh | bash
```

Add this to end of your `~/.bash_profile`
``` sh
export NVM_DIR="$([ -z "${XDG_CONFIG_HOME-}" ] && printf %s "${HOME}/.nvm" || printf %s "${XDG_CONFIG_HOME}/nvm")"
[ -s "$NVM_DIR/nvm.sh" ] && \. "$NVM_DIR/nvm.sh" # This loads nvm
```

### Clone Repo

Go to [https://github.com/requestly/requestly-docs](https://github.com/requestly/requestly-docs)

``` sh
git clone https://github.com/requestly/requestly-docs.git
```

or download the zip from [here](https://github.com/requestly/requestly-docs/archive/refs/heads/master.zip)

### Installation
In the root of cloned Repo

```
$ npm install
```

### Local Development

```
$ npm start
```

This command starts a local development server and opens up a browser window. Most changes are reflected live without having to restart the server.

### Build

```
$ npm run build
```

This command generates static content into the `build` directory and can be served using any static contents hosting service.

### Deployment

Merge the PR in master to deploy the changes
