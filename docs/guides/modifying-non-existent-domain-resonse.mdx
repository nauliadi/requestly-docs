title: Modifying Non-existent Domain Response

## Problem

Sometimes the backend APIs which you are trying to test with frontend aren't ready yet. So you'll see `DNS_PROBE_FINISHED_NXDOMAIN` error when you try to hit these endpoints from frontend. This happens because you're trying to access a “non-existent domain” which DNS probe could not find the matching IP for.

One way you can mock response of these urls is by using Mock Servers. But this solution faces some drawbacks:
- Changing the backend url in your codebase.
- CORS errors

## Solution: Requestly Way

Requestly lets you modify the response of the `Non Existent Urls` without changing anything in your codebase. Here are the steps:

1. Install [Requestly Browser Extension](https://requestly.io/downloads) or [Desktop App](https://requestly.io/desktop).
2. Start creating a Modify Response Rule [here](https://app.requestly.io/rules/editor/create/Response).
3. Enter the non-existent url in the Source Field. Eg. https://non-existent-url.com
4. Enter Response Status that you want to return (By default it returns 404 if you leave it empty).
5. Enter Response Body that needs to be returned. You can either enter `Static Body` or return body `Programmatically`.

That's it. Now you can keep on working on your frontend until your backend APIs are ready :D

> If you want to add some `Response Headers` too, you can do that by creating [`Headers Rule`](/desktop-app/mac/http-modifications/headers-rule) in Requestly.


### Examples

#### Static Body Rule
Rules: https://app.requestly.io/rules#sharedList/1677681178655-Static-Non-existent-domain-modification

<img alt="Static Body" src="/img/docs/guides/non-existent-static.png" width="60%" />

:::info
These rules update the Response body of a non-existent domain (https://non-existent-url.com) to `{"foo": "bar"}` using Static Response Modifications. It also add response headers to it using [`Headers Rule`](/desktop-app/mac/http-modifications/headers-rule);

#### Programmatic Rule: 
Rules: https://app.requestly.io/rules#sharedList/1677681877750-Programmatic-Non-Existent-domain-modification

<img alt="Programmatic" src="/img/docs/guides/non-existent-programmatic.png" width="60%" />

:::info
These rules update the Response body of a non-existent domain (https://non-existent-url.com) to response of https://example.com using Programmatic Response Modifications. It also add response headers to it using [`Headers Rule`](/desktop-app/mac/http-modifications/headers-rule);
