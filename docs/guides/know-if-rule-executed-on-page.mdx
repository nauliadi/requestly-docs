title: Know if a rule executed on the page
---

Once you have enabled a Requestly rule to modify some part of a network request or the page,
next thing you would like to do is to confirm if the rule executed successfully.

Here are multiple ways to know if a rule executed on a page.

## Extension icon turns green

If any of the rules executes on the current page, the Requestly icon in the extension toolbar (next to the address bar) will turn
from a normal icon <img src="/img/icons/extension.png" alt="requestly icon" width="20" style={{verticalAlign: "middle"}} /> to
a green icon <img src="/img/icons/extension-green.png" alt="requestly green icon" width="20" style={{verticalAlign: "middle"}} />.

## Executed rules tab in popup

1. Open the extension popup by clicking on the Requestly icon in the extension toolbar.
2. Switch to *Executed rules* tab.

All the rules which executed in the current page will be listed in this tab.

## Logs in browser console

Whenever a rule is applied, Requestly can print a log in browser console mentioning:
- details of the intercepted network request
- name of rule which was applied

To enable, toggle ON the setting **Enable console logs** from https://app.requestly.io/settings.

To open browser console logs:
1. Right-click on the page and select *Inspect*.
2. Switch to *Console* tab.

## Requestly devtool

1. Right-click on the page and select *Inspect*.
2. Switch to *Requestly* tab.
3. Reload the page.

It should list all intercepted network requested which were modified by Requestly, alongwith the link to rule and the summary of modification.

*Note: Unless the page is reloaded with the devtool opened, it cannot capture the network requests. This is a browser limitation.*

## Rule execution logs

You may also check the execution logs for a rule individually.

1. Go to [Requestly app](https://app.requestly.io/rules/) and open the rule.
2. In the footer, click **Execution Logs** tab.

It should list all the network requests modified by this rule.

*Note: You need to click on Refresh button each time to see the updated results.*
