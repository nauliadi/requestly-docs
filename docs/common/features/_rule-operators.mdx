When you create a modification rule, you will find the following operators: <br/>
- Equals
- Contains
- Matches (Regex)
- Matches (Wildcard)

Lets understand the usecases for each.

<img width="40%" alt="rule operators" src="/img/docs/rule-operators.png" />

## Equals Operator

Equals operator does strict matching of URL intercepted by the browser with the URL given in rule.

Example:

> URL given in rule: http://www.google.com<br/>
> Intercepted URL: http://www.google.com/ (_Observe trailing slash_)<br/>
> Result: ❌ Does not match

### Reason
Note a trailing `/` slash at the end of URL. A rule with `Equals` operator and URL as www.example.com **does not** match www.example.com/.
You may consider adding Slash (`/`) at the end of URL in your rule. You can alternatively create two pairs in the same rule as well.

## Contains Operator

Contains operator does a substring search of string provided in rule inside the URL intercepted by chrome.

Example 1:

> String in rule: yahoo<br/>
> Intercepted URL: https://www.yahoo.com/<br/>
> Result: ✅ Match

Example 2:

> String in rule: com?a=1<br/>
> Intercepted URL: https://www.got.com?a=2<br/>
> Result: ❌ Does not match

### Reason
`com?a=1` is not a substring of a URL and hence it does not match. 

## RegEx Match Operator

Regex Match Operator matches a given Regex with the URL intercepted by chrome.<br/>
You can also use the values of **group expressions in your destination URLs**.

Example:

> URL Matches (Regex): /(.+)\.google/ig<br/>
> Destination: https://$1.google.com<br/>
> Result: ✅ Match

### Reason
In this case, above regex will be matched with intercepted URL.
If regex is matched then $1 will be replaced in the destination URL and redirect will happen.

## Wildcard Match Operator

Wildcard match operator matches expression with the URL intercepted by chrome.<br/>
We only support asterisk (`*`) as wildcard operator. `*` can match **0 or more characters** in intercepted url. <br/>

:::caution 

In wildcard match, complete URL is matched with given expression and `\*` can be replaced with respective values in destination URL. 

:::

Example 1:

> Expression: \*://\*.yahoo.com<br/>
> URL: http://cricket.yahoo.com<br/>
> Result: $1 = http, $2 = cricket

Example 2:

> Expression: \*yahoo<br/>
> URL: http://www.yahoo.com (_Note the trails does not match ie `.com`_)<br/>
> Result: ❌ Does not match

Example 3:

> Expression: \*yahoo\*<br/>
> URL: http://www.yahoo.com<br/>
> Result: $1 = http://www. $2=.com

Example 4:

> Expression: http://\*.yahoo.com<br/>
> URL: http://cricket.yahoo.com/ (_Note the trailing `/` slash in URL_)<br/>
> Result: ❌ Does not match
