With Requestly, you can alter GraphQL API requests and responses through the use of the [request payload](/browser-extension/chrome/features/advance-targetting) filter
in the [modify request](/browser-extension/chrome/http-modifications/request-body-rule) and [modify response](/browser-extension/chrome/http-modifications/response-rule) rules.

## Targeting graphQL queries

GraphQL requests are directed at a single endpoint. So for quering, it is a common practice to pass `operationName`
to differentiate similar queries or for verbose logging on the backend.

## Modifying graphQL responses

Modify response rule targets graphQL requests using request payload.

- The `operationName` is passed as the Request payload of the HTTP request that is meant to carry the GraphQL query to alter the response data returned.
- The response can be modified programmatically or take static data.

> Payload also supports nested path.

## Modifying graphQL queries

The graphQL queries can be modified by using the [modify request body](/browser-extension/chrome/http-modifications/request-body-rule) rule where the request body can be altered.
