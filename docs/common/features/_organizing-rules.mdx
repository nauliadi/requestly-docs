Requestly provides 10 different types of rules that you may create to override
default behavior of network requests in a webpage. And to achieve some
particular use-case, you might have created one or more of these rules. As you
create more and more rules, the list becomes too large to manage.

Requestly provides a feature to organize them into logical **groups**
and enable/disable in one go!
