You can override the default network request behaviour in a webpage by using one of the 10 distinct types of rules that Requestly offers. 
You may have developed one or more of these rules to accomplish a specific use-case. 
The list grows too big to manage as you add more and more rules

Requestly provides a option to organize them into logical groups
and enable/disable in one go!

### Create new group
1. Go to [Requestly Dashboard](app.requestly.io/myrules).
2. Click **New Group** to add all your rules under one group name.
