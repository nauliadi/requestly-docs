The real power of Requestly comes from its different types of rules. It has
lots of different types of rules to offer which gives you complete control
over the HTTP requests.

Requestly provides 10 different types of rules that you may create to override
default behavior of network requests in a webpage. And to achieve some
particular use-case, you might have created one or more of these rules.as you
create more and more rules, the list becomes too large to manage.

Requestly provides a feature to organize them into logical **groups**
and enable/disable in one go!

It allows you to:

- create new group
- move existing rules to a group
- enable/disable group and all its rules in one action
- share/export/import a group of rules
- ungroup existing rules in group
