Every workspace member can have one of three roles

## 1. Member
A member can work collaboratively with other members inside a workspace. So a workspace member can create and update rules, mock servers and session recordings inside that workspace.

## 2. Admin
An admin can do everything that a member can do and also manage the data of the workspace. Admins can add and update the roles of users in a workspace. Admins can also update the workspace information like the workspace name and invite.

## 3. Owner 
A workspace currently only has one owner. The owner is responsible for managing the billing information of a workspace
