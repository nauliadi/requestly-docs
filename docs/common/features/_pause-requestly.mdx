To prevent Requestly rules from impacting your websites or web applications.

#### Follow the steps:

1. Click on the Requestly icon in the toolbar (to the right of the addressbar).
2. Hover over the dropdown menu in the popup that says **Requestly running**.
3. Click **Pause requestly**.<br />
   <img
     width="70%"
     alt="Pause requestly from popup"
     src="/img/docs/popup-pause.webp"
   />

This is useful when you want to identify if Requestly is affecting your website.<br/>
You can try pausing it temporarily to see if the issue persists, or if you are't using it anymore.

:::note

You need to resume it to make Requestly work again.
