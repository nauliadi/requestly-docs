The [User-Agent Request Header](https://requestly.io/feature/cross-device-testing) is most commonly used by servers to identify its client's application type, operating system, software vendor or software version. Based on the User-Agent string, server selects suitable content to be sent in response. For instance, when a website is opened in a mobile device, it usually looks quite compact and different compared to the way it opens in desktop.

Now imagine if your browser allows you to override the User-Agent string, you could see any version of a website you like! All you need to do is to install [Requestly](https://requestly.io/downloads) extension in your browser and enjoy the fun.
You can choose among popular devices like Android Phone, iPhone, tablets or web browsers like Internet Explorer, Safari, etc. Or you may also specify a Custom User-Agent string to experience a specific version of website.

1. **Source Condition** : If the request url matches this *source condition*, then only the rule is applied. You can use `URL`, `Host` or `Path` with `Regex`, `Contains`, `Wildcard` or `Equals` to match the source request.
2. **Device/Browser Selector** : Select whether you want to test on a device or a browser.
3. **Device/Browser Type Selector** : Select the type of browser/deivce which you want to test on.
4. **Source Filters** : This helps you define better targeting conditions and restrict rules to be applied on specific webpages (or domains), request types, request methods, or request payload. Learn more about source filters [here](../features/advance-targeting).
