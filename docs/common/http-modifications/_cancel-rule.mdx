1. **Source Condition** : If the request url matches this *source condition*, then only the rule is applied. You can use `URL`, `Host` or `Path` with `Regex`, `Contains`, `Wildcard` or `Equals` to match the source request.
2. **Source Filters** : This helps you define better targeting conditions and restrict rules to be applied on specific webpages (or domains), request types, request methods, or request payload. Learn more about source filters [here](../features/advance-targeting).


## Common use cases

- **Blocking Websites** â€” You can use Cancel Rule to avoid distraction by blocking websites e.g. youtube, twitter, facebook.
