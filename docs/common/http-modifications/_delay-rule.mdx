Delay rule allows you to add delay to network requests.

## Common use cases

- Test performance of your web app on a slower network conditions.
- Test behaviour of your app when one or more APIs respond slowly (API Latency has gone up).
- Check if any race conditions exist when some resource X gets loaded after/before another resource Y.
- Test the impact of slow loading of external resources impact on your app.
- Test loading experience in the app.

## Matching Requests

All the Requestly rules can match requests based on URL, host, path and [rule operators](/browser-extension/chrome/features/rule-operators). With the help of these operators you
can define rules to match using wildcard, regular expressions or string matching. You can also perform [advanced targeting](/browser-extension/chrome/features/advance-targetting) on the requests.

:::info
Delay is capped automatically to avoid browsing performance degradation.
For XHR/Fetch, max delay is 5000ms & for other resources (JS, CSS, Images etc), max delay is 10000ms

You can also combine this with other rules of requestly, which is helpful in many situations, like somewhere you want to modify the headers of the request after delaying it.
It could be easily solved using requestly.
