As a frontend developer or QA, Testing certain parts of web applications require you to simulate delay in one or more components of the web app. This can be achieved using Requestly Delay Rule.

1. **Source Condition** : If the request url matches this *source condition*, then only the rule is applied. You can use `URL`, `Host` or `Path` with `Regex`, `Contains`, `Wildcard` or `Equals` to match the source request.
2. **Delay Amount** : Delay amount (in milliseconds) which is applied to the request matching the source condition.
3. **Source Filters** : This helps you define better targeting conditions and restrict rules to be applied on specific webpages (or domains), request types, request methods, or request payload. Learn more about source filters [here](../features/advance-targeting).

Delay is capped at 10000ms to avoid browsing performance degradation.

### Common use cases

- Test performance of your web app on a slower network conditions.
- Test behaviour of your app when one or more APIs respond slowly (API Latency has gone up).
- Check if any race conditions exist when some resource X gets loaded after/before another resource Y.
- Test the impact of slow loading of external resources impact on your app.
- Test loading experience in the app.
