The Modify Response Rule allows you to mock the response body of an HTTP request.

:::info
Only API Responses triggered by XHR/fetch can be modified by the browser extension. For other type of requests, use [Desktop App](https://requestly.io/desktop)

:::info
When you edit the rule, please refresh the page on which you are modifying the HTTP response after saving the changes.

### Static Response Modification

In this mode you can enter the response body which you want as the response.

1. **Source Condition** : If the request url matches this *source condition*, then only the rule is applied. You can use `URL`, `Host` or `Path` with `Regex`, `Contains`, `Wildcard` or `Equals` to match the source request.
2. **Status Code** : Update the Response status code. (2XX, 3XX, 4XX, 5XX ...). If left empty, original status code is returned.
3. **Static Response Body** : Define the updated response body which needs to be returned.
4. **Source Filters** : This helps you define better targeting conditions and restrict rules to be applied on specific webpages (or domains), request types, request methods, or request payload. Learn more about source filters [here](../features/advance-targeting).

### Programmatic Response Modification

The existing response can be modified programmatically using JavaScript.
