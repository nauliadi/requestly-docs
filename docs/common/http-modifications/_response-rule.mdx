The Modify Response Rule allows you to mock the response body of an HTTP request.

#### Popular use cases

- You want to work on front-end while back-end is not available or ready yet.
- You want to test application behaviour when provided altered data.
- You want to simulate errors by returning different status codes.
- You want to modify API responses but don't have access to the back-end.

## Types of Modifications
### Static Response Modification

In this mode, you can enter the response body which you want as the response.

1. **Source Condition** : If the request url matches this _source condition_, then only the rule is applied. You can use `URL`, `Host` or `Path` with `Regex`, `Contains`, `Wildcard` or `Equals` to match the source request. Learn more about source conditions [here](/guides/source-condition).
2. **Status Code** : Update the Response status code. (2XX, 3XX, 4XX, 5XX ...). If left empty, original status code is returned.
3. **Static Response Body** : Define the updated response body which needs to be returned.
4. **Source Filters** : This helps you define better targeting conditions and restrict rules to be applied on specific webpages (or domains), request types, request methods, or request payload. Learn more about source filters [here](../features/advance-targeting).

### Programmatic Response Modification

**Programmatic Modification Script (JS)** : Write a JavaScript script which can modify the existing response programmatically.

#### Arguments of `modifyResponse`

1. `method` (string)- The [HTTP method](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Methods) of the request. `GET | POST | PUT | DELETE` etc.
2. `url` (string) - The request URL.
3. `response` (string)- The original response object represented as string. Eg:

```
'{"id":1,"app":"requestly","feature":"modify-request"}'
```

4. `responseType` (string)- The [content-type](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Content-Type) of the HTTP response.
5. `requestHeaders` (Object<string, string>)- The [request headers](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Request_header) sent to the server.
6. `requestData` (string)- The HTTP request payload in case of `POST | PUT | PATCH` requests.
7. `responseJSON` (JSON object)- The original response represented as JSON Object:

```
{
  "id":1,
  "app":"requestly",
  "feature":"modify-request"
}
```

#### Return type of modifyResponse (`string` or `JSON` object)

You can modify both response or responseJSON and return any of them. Response Rule will automatically handle the response returned for the request.

## Targeting GraphQL requests

You can target GraphQL requests using the operation name in request body. To do so add:
-  Payload JSON Key, e.g., `operationName`
-  Value, e.g., `getUsers`
