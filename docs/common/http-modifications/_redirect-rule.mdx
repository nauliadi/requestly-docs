As the name suggests, the redirect rule allows you to redirect a sepcific request URL (or matching pattern) to another URL.

1. **Source Condition**: Source condition is where you set criteria for the rules. You can use `URL`, `Host` or `Path` with `Regex`, `Contains`, `Wildcard` or `Equals` to match the source request. Learn more about source conditions [here](/guides/source-condition).
2. **Destination URL**: The destination to which the users will be redirected to based on the source condition.
3. **Source Filters**: You can define better targeting conditions and restrict rules to be applied on specific webpages (or domains), request types, request methods, or request payload. Learn more about source filters [here](../features/advance-targeting).


### Popular use cases

- **Redirect Production to Local Environment:** Map your production scripts or APIs to your local running code and test your local code directly on production sites without deployment. [Here's](https://requestly.io/blog/how-to-load-local-js-files-on-live-production-sites) an article with more explanation.
- **Redirect to local System files (Map Local):** With Requestly, you get our very own Mock Server Integration out of the box with the Redirect Request Rule. No need for a separate localhost server when the work can be easier! You can find more details [here](../../../desktop-app/mac/features/map-local).
- **Test API version changes:** Suppose there is a new version of some API which you are using. To test the backward compatibility of the API, you can just set up a redirect rule to redirect all URLs from the older version to the newer version and check if your application behaves as expected. This way, you don't need to change a single line of your code and test the API upgrades.
- **Fix Broken URLs, Redirect dead bookmarks, and Create URL shortcuts:** You can setup a redirect rule to fix some broken URLs, redirect the dead bookmarks to new working bookmarks and create URL shortcuts.
- **Swap Tag Manager scripts from production to staging/dev environment:** Test your dev implementation in tag manager scripts like Adobe DTM, Tealium Tag, Google Tag Manager Containers before pushing them live on client websites.
