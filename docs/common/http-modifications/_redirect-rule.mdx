The redirect rule allows you to redirect a request URL (or matching pattern) to another URL. 

### Parts of Redirect Rule
<img src="/img/docs/annotated-redirect-rule.png" alt="Redirect Rule"/>

- **Source Condition** : This is the *source condition* when rule is applied. You can use `URL`, `Host` or `Path` with `Regex`, `Contains`, `Wildcard` or `Equals` to match the source request.
- **Destination Url** : This is the destination url for the redirect when request Source Condition Matches.


### Popular use cases

- **Redirect Production to Local Environment:** Map your production scripts or APIs to your local running code and test your local code directly on production sites without deployment.
- **Redirect to local System files (Map Local):** With Requestly, you get our very own Mock Server Integration out of the box with the Redirect Request Rule. No need for a separate localhost server when the work can be easier! You can find more details [here](https://docs.requestly.tech/browser-extension/chrome/features/map-local).
- **Test API version changes:** Suppose there is a new version of some API which you are using. To test the backward compatibility of the API, you can just set up a redirect rule to redirect all URLs from the older version to the newer version and check if your application behaves as expected. This way, you donâ€™t need to change a single line of your code and test the API upgrades.
- **Fix Broken Urls, Redirect dead bookmarks, and Create URL shortcuts:** You can setup a redirect rule to fix some broken URLs, redirect the dead bookmarks to new working bookmarks and create URL shortcuts.
- **Swap Tag Manager scripts from production to staging/dev environment:** Test your dev implementation in tag manager scripts like Adobe DTM, Tealium Tag, Google Tag Manager Containers before pushing them live on client websites.
