Rules are a powerful feature that allows you to customize your web browsing experience. They allow you to define conditions that, when met, trigger a certain action. 

For example, you could create a rule that redirects a certain URL to another URL or blocks a certain type of request. You can also use rules to modify request headers, add query parameters to requests, or delay requests to simulate network conditions. 

With Requestly, you have the power to take complete control over the HTTP requests that flow through your browser.
