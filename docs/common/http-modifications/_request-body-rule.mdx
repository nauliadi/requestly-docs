Modifying the request payload is the process of changing the data that is sent to a server when making an HTTP request. You can use Modify Request Body rule to override the API request body with static data or programmatically modify the existing request payload.

# Popular Use Cases:

- **Primarily used in Sending additional data in request payload to the API server:** There might be situations where additional data needs to be sent in request payloads to the API server when making a POST or PUT request.
- **Modifying GraphQL Queries:** GraphQL queries can be modified by modifying the request body of the request. This can be done by changing the query string or variables in the request body.
- **Testing different edge cases:** You may modify an API request payload to include an invalid or unsupported field. The API request will likely be rejected by the server, and an error message will be returned.
