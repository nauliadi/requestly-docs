Replace Rule allows users to replace a string (or matching pattern) with another string in the URL.

1. **Source Condition**: Source condition is where you set criteria for the rules. You can use `URL`, `Host`, or `Path` with `Regex`, `Contains`, `Wildcard`, or `Equals` to match the source request. Learn more about source conditions [here](/guides/source-condition).
2. **Destination URL**: The destination to which the users will be redirected based on the source condition.
3. **Source Filters**: You can define better targeting conditions and restrict rules to be applied on specific web pages (or domains), request types, request methods, or request payloads. Learn more about source filters [here](../features/advance-targeting).


### Popular use cases

- **Switch Domains:** To test your app with the new changes done on the local server, you can use replace `my-app-server.com` with `localhost:4000` using Replace Rule. By this way, you can test your app without having to change any of your code.
- **Change Query Parameter Values:** You can change the values of query parameters present in a URL. For example: Changing `?dl-0` to `?dl=1` in a dropbox URL downloads the file directly without going to the usual preview page.
- **Fix broken/updated URLs:** There might be situations where you might be using links to some documentation or blog posts that have been changed/updated, however, you don't want to change the URLs in your code. In such cases, you can use replace rule to redirect the old resource to new one.
