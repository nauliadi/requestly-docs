# Popular Use Cases

- Switch Domains: To test your app with the new changes done on the local server, you can use Replace Rule to replace `my-app-server.com` with `localhost:4000` in all URLs, thus allowing you to test your app without having to change any of your code.
- Change Query Parameter Values: You can change the values of query parameters present in a URL. For example: Changing `?dl-0` to `?dl=1` in a dropbox URL downloads the file directly without going to the usual preview page.
- Fix broken/updated URLs: There might be situations where links to some documentation or blog posts have been changed/updated, but you have developed a typing habit of old URLs. Well, you can use replace rule to achieve that use case.
