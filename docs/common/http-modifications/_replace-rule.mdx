Replace Rule allows users to replace a string (or matching pattern) with another string in the URL.

1. **Source Condition** : This is the *source condition* for which rule is applied. You can use `URL`, `Host` or `Path` with `Regex`, `Contains`, `Wildcard` or `Equals` to match the source request. Learn more about source conditions [here](/guides/source-condition).
2. **Replace From** : This is the text in the request URL which need to be replaced.
3. **Replace With** : This is what `Replace from` text is replaced with.
4. **Source Filters** : This helps you define better targeting conditions and restrict rules to be applied on specific webpages (or domains), request types, request methods, or request payload. Learn more about source filters [here](../features/advance-targeting).


### Popular use cases

- **Switch Domains:** To test your app with the new changes done on the local server, you can use Replace Rule to replace `my-app-server.com` with `localhost:4000` in all URLs, thus allowing you to test your app without having to change any of your code.
- **Change Query Parameter Values:** You can change the values of query parameters present in a URL. For example: Changing `?dl-0` to `?dl=1` in a dropbox URL downloads the file directly without going to the usual preview page.
- **Fix broken/updated URLs:** There might be situations where links to some documentation or blog posts have been changed/updated, but you have developed a typing habit of old URLs. Well, you can use replace rule to achieve that use case.
