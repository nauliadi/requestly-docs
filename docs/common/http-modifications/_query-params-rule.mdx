Using Requestly, you can modify the query params that are send to the server. 
You `Add` a new query param, `change` the value of the existing param or `remove`
all/specific query param from the URL.

1. **Source Condition** : If the request URL matches this _source condition_, then only the rule is applied. You can use `URL`, `Host` or `Path` with `Regex`, `Contains`, `Wildcard` or `Equals` to match the source request.
2. **Param Modification** : This is the actual query param modification which needs to be performed. You can `Add`, `Remove`, `Override` the query params of the matched URL.
3. **Source Filters** : This helps you define better targeting conditions and restrict rules to be applied on specific webpages (or domains), request types, request methods, or request payload. Learn more about source filters [here](../features/advance-targeting).
