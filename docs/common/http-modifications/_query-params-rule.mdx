1. **Source Condition** : If the request URL matches this _source condition_, then only the rule is applied. You can use `URL`, `Host` or `Path` with `Regex`, `Contains`, `Wildcard` or `Equals` to match the source request.
2. **Param Name** : Name of param which you want to add, overrride or remove.
3. **Param Value** : Value of the respective param name.
4. **Param Modification** : This is the actual query param modification which needs to be performed. You can `Add`, `Remove`, `Override` the query params of the matched URL.
