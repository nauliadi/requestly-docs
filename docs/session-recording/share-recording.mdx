## Sharing options

1. **Private to me**: select if you don't want to share the recording with anyone and just want to keep it for your future reference.
2. **Anyone with the link**: select if you want the recording to be accessed by anyone on the internet.
3. **All members of my organization** - select if you want the recording to be accessed by anyone in your organization. _The support for this option is coming soon..._
4. **Only with specific people** - select if you want only specific people to access it.

As the owner of the recording, you will always be able to access it, modify or change the above setting.
