# Session Recording

Session Recording helps you to share debug sessions from your machine to your developers or QAs with video, network logs, console logs, environment details, etc. being part of the debug session.

Your QA and customer support team can readily share these recorded sessions, so you can reproduce and debug issues faster.
When you use our [Session recording](https://requestly.io/feature/session-recording) feature, it automatically captures video of browsing sessions, environment details, network API logs, and console logs all bundled together in one recording. 

:::note

Screen Recording is available with browser extension only. Supported browsers are:
[Chrome](/browser-extension/chrome/getting-started/installation),
[Firefox](/browser-extension/firefox/getting-started/installation),
[Edge](/browser-extension/edge/getting-started/installation),
[Brave](/browser-extension/chrome/getting-started/installation) and
[Opera](/browser-extension/chrome/getting-started/installation).
However, the recorded sessions can be viewed in any browser even without the extension.
