To prevent Requestly rules from intercepting and modifying the requests of your websites, you can `Pause Requestly` temporarily. This comes in handy when you want to test the original behaviour without Requestly affecting your website.

### Pause Requestly:

1. Click on the Requestly icon in the toolbar (to the right of the addressbar).
2. Hover over the dropdown menu in the popup that says **Requestly running**.
3. Click **Pause requestly**.<br />
