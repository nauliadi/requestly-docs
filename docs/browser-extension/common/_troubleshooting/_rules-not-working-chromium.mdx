<h3>Check if Extension is activated</h3>


It might be possible that you might have deactivated the extension by mistake. To activate the extension, follow the steps [here](../features/pause-requestly#resume)

<h3>Check if status of Group under which rule is present is active</h3>

<p>
  Groups allow you to organize rules into logical groups and enable/disable them
  in one go. <br /> For a Rule to work, it’s group must be active.
