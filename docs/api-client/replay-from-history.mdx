# Replay request from History

A history of all the requests triggered from the API Client can be seen on the left sidebar. The most recent request is shown on the top.

<img src="/img/docs/api-client/history.png" alt="history" width="800" />

You may click and load any request from the history to the API client and replay by editing some fields.

Unless the page is refreshed, the response of a request triggered in the session is also cached and can be viewed by selecting the request.

## Clearing history

Click **Clear history** button on top of the history sidebar to clear all the requests in history.

## Limitations

- Only last 20 requests are maintained in the history.
- The history is maintained only for the current browser.
