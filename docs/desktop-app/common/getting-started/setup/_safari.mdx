Intercepting traffic from safari is as simple as intercepting from any other browser on requestly.

1. Click the `Connect apps` button as shown below.

2. Click on `Launch` in safari tab to start the interception.

This should also launch a new Safari instance for you to start debugging

:::note
When you launch safari from Requestly, it sets a system wide proxy due to technical constraints.

So in case you see any network glitches after your debugging session is complete, please make sure that you're system proxy has been turned off.

Although requestly handles this automatically for you, but you can never be too safe ðŸ˜‰
