To start intercepting and modifying network traffic from a browser using Requestly, you need to connect the browser first. Follow the steps to connect browser of your choice.

1. Go to the conneced apps section. This should show you a list of the detected browsers on your system, along with other sources that Requestly supports

> If you are trying to intercept traffic on an existing browser profile, all running instances of that browser will first be closed. So make sure to save any progress that you might have made before starting the interception.


3. To close the launched browser, just click the `Close` for that browser inside the connected apps list.
