3. If the command succeeds, you should see `Requestly interception` enabled in your terminal.
4. Now all you requests from you NodeJS server should show up in the `Network Traffic` Tab.

:::caution
https requests in axios might not show up properly in Network Traffic tab due to the way axios handles HTTPS requests. But the actual request will work properly in your code as expected.

Checkout [Github Issue](https://github.com/requestly/requestly/issues/301) for more explanation and quick hack on how to apply rules on these requests.
