Requestly's `Network Traffic` provides you with a powerful tool for
inspecting and analyzing network traffic, allowing you to
identify potential issues and optimize your application's performance.

Inspecting network traffic is an important aspect of developing and
maintaining a high-performance, reliable application. It can be difficult to
effectively monitor and analyze network requests and responses, leading to problems
like slow page load times, error messages, etc.

With Requestly's network traffic tool, you can monitor network incoming and
outgoing traffic. You can gain insight into important details such as :

- URL
- HTTP method (e.g. GET, POST, etc.) used for the request
- request and response headers
- response payload
- timing information and more
