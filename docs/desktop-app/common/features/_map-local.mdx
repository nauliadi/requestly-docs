This feature enables you to serve any local file as the response of an intercepted request in `Realtime`.
You can make changes in the file locally and test them live without updating them on the server.
The contents of the local file is returned to the client as if it was the normal remote response.

## Use cases

You can use it for testing css, images, javascript assets etc. by mapping the local development file to the live version so that you can browse
the actual site with the development assets without deploying.

## How to use

You can use the [Redirect rule](../http-modifications/redirect-rule) to map a request to a local file.
This redirects the request to the local file, causing it to be served in response to that request.
