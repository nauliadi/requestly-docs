Map Local feature lets you to serve any local file as the response of an intercepted request in realtime.
You can make changes in the file locally and test them live without updating them on the server.
The contents of the local file is returned to the client as if it was the normal remote response.

## How to use?

You can use the [Redirect rule](../http-modifications/redirect-rule) to map a request to a local file.
This redirects the request to the local file, causing it to be served in response to that request.
