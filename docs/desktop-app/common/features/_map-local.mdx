This feature enables you to serve any local file as the response of an intercepted request.
You can make changes in the file locally and test them live without updating them on the server.
The contents of the local file is returned to the client as if it was the normal remote response.

## Use cases

You can use it for testing css, images, javascript assets etc. by mapping the local development file to the live version so that you can browse
the actual site with the development assets without deploying.

## How to use

You can use the [Redirect rule](/browser-extension/chrome/http-modifications/redirect-rule) to map a request to a local file.
This redirects the request to the local file, causing it to be served in response to that request.

## Matching Requests

All the Requestly rules can match requests based on URL, host, path and [rule operators](/browser-extension/chrome/features/rule-operators). With the help of these operators you
can define rules to match using wildcard, regular expressions or string matching. You can also perform [advanced targeting](/browser-extension/chrome/features/advance-targetting) on the requests using source filters.

_This feature is only available in the [Requestly Desktop App ](https://requestly.io/downloads)._
