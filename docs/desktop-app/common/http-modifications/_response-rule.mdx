The Modify Response Rule allows you to mock the response body of an HTTP request.

## Common use cases

- You want to modify API responses but don't have access to the back-end.
- You want to mock fluctuating API responses.
- You want to test application behaviour when provided altered data source.

## Matching Requests

All the Requestly rules can match requests based on URL, host, path and [rule operators](/browser-extension/chrome/features/rule-operators). With the help of these operators you
can define rules to match using wildcard, regular expressions or string matching. You can also perform [advanced targeting](/browser-extension/chrome/features/advance-targetting) on the requests.

## Different ways to modify the response of a API

### Mock with static data

In this mode you can enter the response body which you want as the response.

### Mock the response status code

You can also mock the response status code by selecting a status code from our predefined list or entering a code.

### Modify existing/original response

The existing response can be modified programmatically using JavaScript

Based on the received arguments, you can return a new response which can be a string or an JavaScript object in the expected format.
