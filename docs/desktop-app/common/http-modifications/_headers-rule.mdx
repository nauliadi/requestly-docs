  <summary>Request Headers not showing in browser network panel</summary>
  <div>
    Due to technical constraints, request headers modified using Requestly won't show up in the browser network panel. <b>But the headers actually received by the server are modified.</b><br/>
    You can see the modified headers sent to the server in the Desktop App `Network Traffic` Section.
