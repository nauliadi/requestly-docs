title: Troubleshooting Safari
---

Safari does not support setting a proxy on the browser instance due to technical constraints. Therefore, we have to set up a system-wide proxy to connect to Safari. This may lead to some issues, which can be resolved by following troubleshooting steps:

Before following the troubleshooting steps, make sure you have done both of these setup for Safari: 

1. **Make sure to launch Safari App from the Connected Apps modal.** In case Safari doesn't open automatically, you can open it yourself also.
2. Try openingÂ [https://amiusing.requestly.io/](https://amiusing.requestly.io/) after launching Safari. 
If it shows `Failure` message, then it indicates that traffic is not being intercepted by Requestly and your proxy isn't set up properly. Follow the below steps to troubleshoot the most common problems with setting up Safari.


### VPN Issue

Safari connection might not work with VPN because of the system-wide proxy setup. **If you are using Requestly with VPN, you need to disable VPN first, then launch Safari from `Connected Apps` and then restart your VPN.**

### Check Certificate

For Requestly to intercept HTTPS traffic, you need to install Requestly Certificate in the keychain
- Open keychain access (Press cmd + enter and then type "keychain")
- Select login keychain
- Check whether RQProxyCA is present and trusted or not.

### Check Firewall

Check if you are using any Firewall software like Sophos. Firewalls generally block web proxies for security reasons and mistake Requestly as a web proxy but Requestly only runs on yourlocal device. Sending them an email will get Requestly unblocked for you.
